# Red Wine Quality Prediction Using Classification Modelling and Machine Learning
### Data Understanding

My analysis will use Red Wine Quality Data Set, available on the UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). It contains the red wine samples from the north of Portugal to model red wine quality based on physicochemical tests. The dataset contains a total of 12 variables, which were recorded for 1,599 observations. This data will allow us to create different classification models to determine how different independent variables help predict our dependent variable, quality.The variables are as follows:
1. Alcohol: Amount of alcohol(ethanol) present
2. Volatile acidity: high acetic acid in wine which have an unwelcoming vinegar taste
3. Sulphates: a wine additive that is generally used to save and cover the wines from bacteria 
4. Citric Acid: Used in wines that are naturally lacking in acid. It helps bring out the fruity flavour of the wine
5. Total Sulphur Dioxide:  gives a pungent smell
6. Density: thickness of the wine
7. Chlorides: Generally referred to as salt in the wine
8. Fixed acidity: are non-volatile acids like tartaric or malic acids
9. pH: the level of acidity in the wines.
10. Free Sulphur Dioxide: it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
11. Residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after the fermentation process
12. Quality â€“ the score ranges between 3-8.
